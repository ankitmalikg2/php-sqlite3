Implementation of sqlite in PHP
<hr>

This is a repo which is simple implementation of sqlite3 in PHP.

SQLite does not require any setup or server (server-less embeded datbase).
It will generate a .db file. 
This is not a replacement of full-featured SQL databases. 

To implement this you have to enable the SQLite3 extention in PHP.

<hr>
To add sqlite3 extention in linux environment use the command
<code>sudo apt-get install php-sqlite3</code>

To if SQLite3 is installed in PHP use following command<br>
<code>php -m </code>
